    <p>
      Mist-to-Meadow is a project to transform barren coastal lands into thriving
      green ecosystems by capturing water directly from the air. From the sun-drenched
      shores of the Mediterranean and the dry coasts of the Sea of Cortez to islands in
      the Caribbean, vast areas lie beside oceans yet remain arid and lifeless. Not from
      lack of proximity to water, but from the inability to access it. These barren
      coastlines contribute to desertification, reduce biodiversity, and miss opportunities
      for carbon capture.
